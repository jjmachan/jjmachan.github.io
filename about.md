 My name is **Jithin James** (*but you can call me JJ* ) and I’m a Computer
 Science student from Kerala. I love to code and build things and I’m also super
 exicted about machine learning and AI. I like to think a lot about how to
 improve Deep Learning algorithms and learning about new frontiers in AI. Right
 now, I work on building and scaling ML systems to help people do stuff more
 efficiently or automate their everyday tasks so they have more time to do what
 they love. I’m learning more about building ML systems and workflows that
 manage and scale data pipelines, training and inferencing of machine learning
 models.

 I prefer `Neovim`, `i3`, `tmux` in my software development and I tend to prefer
 tools like these because of how effective they make my workflow.

 When I’m not sitting in front of my computer, I’m probably riding my motorbike
 and I love it! I love travelling, meeting new people and having new
 experiences. It broadens your view about the world and makes you more emphatic
 (you also have a shit load of fun, obviously!). I’m also into photography and
 love films. (*I have some blogs lined up about my travels and photography, so
 check this space later to read them* )
